                        <p>I am a Developer and Designer who loves tangible results. When I'm not behind my screen perfecting pixels, I'm probably busy with crochet. What binds these two worlds? Translating a complex pattern into a final product that just works. In my code, I strive for the same precision and 'cozy' aesthetic that I seek in my handiwork.</p>

                        <h3>Why this degree?</h3>
                        <p>I chose this degree because I was looking for the perfect balance between the logic of programming and the visual nature of design.</p>

                            <h4>The Concept</h4>
                            <p>A "Work Place Learning" assignment aimed to move beyond the static paper resume and design a Dashboard CV that reflects my professional identity. My goal was to incorporate my design and create a "Dark Cozy Purple" interface that feels personal and cozy.</p>

                            <h4>The Process (Iterative Design)</h4>
                            <p><strong>I followed a strict 4-stage design cycle:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Research & Sketches:</strong> Analyzing dashboard layouts and sketching on paper.</li>
                                <li><strong>Wireframing:</strong> Building the structural layout in Figma to establish visual hierarchy.</li>
                                <li><strong>Visual Design:</strong> Applying my "Dark Cozy Purple" moodboard, selecting the Lora/Mulish typography, and defining the glassmorphism style.</li>
                                <li><strong>Feedback Loops:</strong> Worked in a "Buddy Team," processing weekly peer feedback to refine the usability and aesthetics of the final concept.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>What I Designed (Figma Workflow)</h4>
                            <p><strong>Design System:</strong> Created a scalable global style guide including:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Color Styles:</strong> Defined colors.</li>
                                <li><strong>Typography:</strong> A strict type scale using Lora (Headings) and Mulish (UI text).</li>
                                <li><strong>Effect Styles:</strong> Custom "Glass Morphism" effects saved as reusable styles.</li>
                            </ul>
                        
                            <p><strong>Component Architecture:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Built small components (Buttons, Tags, Icons) combined into larger components (Calendar Cards, Music Player, Kanban Columns).</li>
                                <li>Consistent spacing and padding within modules.</li>
                                <li>Created Component Variants to visualize states (e.g., Active vs. Inactive Sidebar tabs, Hover states for buttons).</li>
                            </ul>
                        
                            <p><strong>Visual Exploration:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Designed specific modules for user needs: A "70/30 Split" Calendar for exam prioritization and a "Crochet Studio" widget to visualize hobby tracking.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>The Concept</h4>
                            <p><strong>EOSCert Belgium</strong> is a comprehensive certification management platform designed to handle the certification processes for EOS standards. The primary interface is for companies and the public. It serves as an informational hub and a functional tool for requesting quotes, submitting complaints, and verifying certificates.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Key Features</h4>
                            <h4>Public Portal:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Dynamic Quote Request Engine:</strong> A complex, multi-step form that captures detailed organizational data (standards, audit scope, employee counts). Upon submission, the backend dynamically generates a formatted Microsoft Word (`.docx`) document containing all the data and emails it to the administration for review.</li>
                                <li><strong>Certificate Verification:</strong> A public tool that allows anyone to verify the validity of a certificate. Users can scan a QR code. The system validates this against the database and returns the certificate status, ensuring transparency and trust.</li>
                                <li><strong>Contact & Complaint Management:</strong> Dedicated forms for general inquiries and formal complaints. These forms are protected by reCAPTCHA and trigger immediate email notifications to the support team.</li>
                                <li><strong>Internationalization:</strong> The site is built with multi-language support in mind, utilizing `Transloco` to serve content in different languages.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Backend Infrastructure</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with CSP:</strong> The application is served via a Cloud Function that injects a strict, nonce-based Content Security Policy (CSP) into the `index.html` at runtime. This provides a high level of security against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.</li>
                                <li><strong>Automated Communication:</strong> Extensive use of transactional emails (via `Nodemailer` and Gmail) to keep all stakeholders informed about application status, quotes, and inquiries.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>The Concept</h4>
                            <p>The <strong>EOSCert Belgium</strong> platform relies on Cloud Firestore, a scalable NoSQL document database, to manage critical data such as certification records, user applications, and dynamic content. The database is designed to support real-time updates and strict security rules.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Data Management Strategy</h4>
                            <p>The database is architected to handle distinct domains of data while ensuring isolation and performance:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Certification Records:</strong> Stores comprehensive details about certified companies and their validity status. This data serves as the single source of truth for the public verification tool.</li>
                                <li><strong>Admin Onboarding:</strong> Manages the lifecycle of administrator access requests, tracking the status from initial application to final approval or denial.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h4>Security & Access Control</h4>
                            <p>Security is enforced via <strong>Firestore Security Rules</strong>, implementing a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Role-Based Access:</strong> Only users with specific custom claims (`ADMIN`, `OWNER`) can read or write sensitive documents.</li>
                                <li><strong>Least Privilege:</strong> Public access is completely restricted at the database level. Public data retrieval (e.g., certificate verification) is proxied exclusively through secure Cloud Functions (`getCertificateData`), ensuring no direct client-side access to the DB.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Privacy & Compliance (GDPR)</h4>
                            <p>To adhere to privacy regulations like GDPR, the architecture implements several safeguards:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> Only essential business data is stored. Personal data is limited to what is strictly necessary for certification and contact purposes.</li>
                                <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Strict RBAC ensures that only authorized personnel can access sensitive records.</li>
                                <li><strong>Indirect Access:</strong> Public users cannot query the database directly. All public-facing data is filtered and sanitized by backend Cloud Functions before being returned to the client, preventing accidental exposure of private fields.</li>
                                <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Data is encrypted at rest by Google Cloud Platform standards and in transit via HTTPS.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Integration & Automation</h4>
                            <p>The database acts as an event bus for serverless logic:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Triggers:</strong> Changes in the 'user-applications' collection (e.g., status change to 'approved') automatically trigger Cloud Functions to create user accounts and send email notifications.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cloud Functions:</strong> The 'getCertificateData' function queries 'CertificationApplications' to validate certificates based on complex ID parsing logic.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                            <p>I approach crochet with the same mindset I use for core programming: iterative logic. Just as a "for" loop executes a block of code repeatedly until a condition is met, a crochet pattern relies on repeating specific stitch sequences to build structure. Whether I'm defining a function in JavaScript or working a complex stitch repeat in wool, the goal is the same writing clean, bug-free instructions to achieve a functional output.</p>
